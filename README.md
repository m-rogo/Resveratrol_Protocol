# Resveratrol_Protocol
This contains python code used to run experimental design for resveratrol biosynthesis Cell-Free using an Opentrons-OT2 pipetting robot. 

Three protocols were made for high-rate, mid-rate and low-rate resveratrol producing enzymes to test the effect of varying enzyme concentration on resveratrol production after 24 hours. These protocols can be matched with their corresponding excel files which details the experimental design for each protocol

The excel files for each experimental design contains the following information: 
    - The enzymes, buffers and other reactants required to carry out protocol
    - The required labware, slot locations for labware in Opentrons-OT2 robot, locations and the required concentration for each stock solution in the corresponding       labware 
    - The concentrations and final volumes for enzymes, reactants and buffers, as well as their plate mapping mapping
